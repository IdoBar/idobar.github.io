My research falls into three main areas: **systematics (and taxonomy)**, **molecular biology** and **biogreography**. Research projects often combine these areas to investigate morphological change, speciation and macroevolutionary patterns. For published outcomes from research projects and collaborations, see full list of [publications](https://lawleyjw.com/publications/).

## Key projects

### Drivers of colour variation in jellyfish

</p>
Color can play an important role in an organismâ€™s survival, providing camouflage and photoprotection, and influencing sexual selection and social interactions. The goal of this project was to investigate the endogenous and exogenous drivers of colour variation in the blubber jellyfish <i>Catostylus mosaicus</i>.

### Systematics of the moon jellyfish genus <i>Aurelia</i>

</p>
Since the 19th century, taxonomists have puzzled on how to separate supposed moon jellyfish species. In this project, morphological and molecular data were analysed from a wide range of specimens to delimit and describe the cryptic species in the genus.

### Phylogeography of the box jellyfish <i>Alatina alata</i>
<p align="center">

</p>
<i>Alatina</i> jellyfish are notorious for their sting along beaches where they occur, but it has been unclear whether they are distinct or a single species with worldwide distribution. A phylogeographic analyses was reported, which corroborated morphological and behavioural evidence to indicate the presence of a single, pantropically distributed species.
