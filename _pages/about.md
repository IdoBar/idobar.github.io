Under construction

Welcome! I am an evolutionary biologist interested in marine invertebrates, especially jellyfish, and my research is focused on applying traditional morphological analyses, ecological experiments and omics tools to understand morphological variation and speciation, as well as biogeographic and macroevolutionary trends. More broadly, my experience with research and education in biology ranges from studies in ecological succession and invasive species to systematics/taxonomy and biogeography. 

I am currently a PhD Candidate at Griffith University (expected completion - March, 2023). I earned my MSc in Zoology from the University of SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil) and my BSc in Biological Sciences from the Federal University of Santa Catarina.
