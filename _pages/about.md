Welcome! I am an evolutionary biologist interested in marine invertebrates, especially jellyfish. My [research](https://lawleyjw.github.io/research/) is focused on applying omics tools, morphological analyses and ecological experiments to understand morphological variation and speciation, as well as biogeographic and macroevolutionary trends. My experience also involves teaching and outreach in courses, workshops, seminars and conferences, reviewing and editing academic texts, as well as programming and [bioinformatics](https://lawleyjw.github.io/bioinformatics/).

I am currently a PhD Candidate at Griffith University, Australia (2019 - March, 2023). I earned my MSc in Zoology from the University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil (2016 - 2018) and my BSc in Biological Sciences from the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil (2009 - 2015).
