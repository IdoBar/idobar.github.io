Welcome! I am an evolutionary biologist with a special interest in marine invertebrates. My [research](https://lawleyjw.github.io/research/) integrates omics tools, morphological analyses, and field- and lab-based investigations to unravel patterns and drivers of diversification, as well as the underlying mechanisms of evolutionary change. My experience also involves teaching in various formal and informal settings, reviewing and editing academic texts, as well as programming and [bioinformatics](https://lawleyjw.github.io/bioinformatics/).
<br/>
<br/>
I am a Research Fellow in Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics at the [Centre for Planetary Health and Food Security](https://www.griffith.edu.au/centre-planetary-health-food-security) at [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au). I earned my PhD from [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au), Australia (2019 - 2023), my MSc in Zoology from the University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil (2016 - 2018), and my BSc in Biological Sciences from the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil (2009 - 2015).
